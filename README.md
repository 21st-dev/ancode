# 1Code

[1Code.dev](https://1code.dev)

Best UI for Claude Code with local and remote agent execution.

By [21st.dev](https://21st.dev) team

> **Note:** Currently tested on macOS and Linux. Windows support is experimental and may have issues.

## Features

- **Plan & Agent Modes** - Read-only analysis or full code execution permissions
- **Project Management** - Link local folders with automatic Git remote detection
- **Real-time Tool Execution** - See bash commands, file edits, and web searches as they happen
- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Each chat session runs in its own isolated worktree
- **Integrated Terminal** - Full terminal access within the app
- **Change Tracking** - Visual diffs and PR management

## 🔌 Plugin System (Experimental)

1Code includes an experimental plugin architecture that allows extending functionality
without modifying core code.

Plugins can:
- Register custom commands
- Hook into application lifecycle
- Enable future extensions like linters, formatters, and AI tools

See `src/shared/plugins/samplePlugin.ts` for a minimal example.


## Installation

### Option 1: Build from source (free)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Bun, Python, Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)
bun install
bun run claude:download  # Download Claude binary (required!)
bun run build
bun run package:mac  # or package:win, package:linux
```

> **Important:** The `claude:download` step downloads the Claude CLI binary which is required for the agent chat to work. If you skip this step, the app will build but agent functionality won't work.

### Option 2: Subscribe to 1code.dev (recommended)

Get pre-built releases + background agents support by subscribing at [1code.dev](https://1code.dev).

Your subscription helps us maintain and improve 1Code.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run claude:download  # First time only
bun run dev
```

## Codespaces & Linux Notes

When running the Electron app inside **GitHub Codespaces**, Docker containers,
or minimal Linux environments, the UI may fail to launch due to the absence of
an X11 display server.

This is expected behavior and does **not** block development or builds.

If you encounter dependency resolution issues, use:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

On Linux, Electron may require additional system libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libatk1.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2
```

You can still validate your changes by running:

```bash
npm run build
```
